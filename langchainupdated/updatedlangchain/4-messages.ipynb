       "AIMessage(content='<think>\\nOkay, so I need to explain what artificial intelligence is. Let me start by recalling what I know. AI is a term I hear a lot, especially with things like chatbots, self-driving cars, and recommendation systems. But how do I define it accurately?\\n\\nFirst, the basics. Artificial Intelligence, or AI, refers to machines or computers performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. But what does that really mean? It\\'s not just doing simple tasks; it\\'s more complex things like learning, problem-solving, understanding language, and even recognizing patterns.\\n\\nWait, but there\\'s a difference between narrow AI and general AI. Narrow AI is what we have now, designed for specific tasks, like Siri or Google Assistant. General AI would be more like a human, capable of understanding and learning any intellectual task. But we haven\\'t achieved that yet, right?\\n\\nHow does AI work? I think it involves machine learning, which is a subset of AI. Machine learning algorithms use data to learn patterns and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. For example, a spam filter learns from examples of spam and non-spam emails to classify new ones.\\n\\nThen there\\'s deep learning, which uses neural networks with multiple layers. These are inspired by the human brain\\'s structure and are used in image and speech recognition. So, deep learning is part of machine learning, which is part of AI. That\\'s a hierarchy to remember: AI > Machine Learning > Deep Learning.\\n\\nApplications of AI are widespread. In healthcare, AI can help diagnose diseases from medical images. In finance, it\\'s used for fraud detection. Self-driving cars use AI for navigation and object recognition. Recommendations on Netflix or Amazon are powered by AI algorithms predicting your preferences.\\n\\nBut there are challenges and ethical considerations. Issues like data privacy, bias in algorithms, job displacement due to automation, and the potential misuse of AI in surveillance or autonomous weapons. Also, ensuring transparency in AI decisions, known as explainability, is a big concern.\\n\\nI should also mention some key concepts in AI. Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows machines to understand and generate human language. Computer vision lets them interpret and process visual data. Robotics integrates AI with physical systems for tasks like assembly line manufacturing.\\n\\nHistory-wise, AI has had several waves. The Dartmouth Conference in 1956 is considered the birth of AI as a field. There were periods of optimism followed by \"AI winters\" when progress slowed due to unmet expectations. Recent advancements in computing power and data availability have led to the current boom in AI applications.\\n\\nSo putting it all together, AI is a broad field aiming to create systems that can perform intelligent tasks. It includes various techniques like machine learning and deep learning, with applications across many industries. However, it comes with challenges that need addressing for responsible development.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is a multidisciplinary field of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, language understanding, and decision-making. AI can be categorized into two main types:\\n\\n### 1. **Narrow AI (Weak AI)**  \\n   - **Definition**: Designed for specific, limited tasks. It operates within a predefined scope and cannot perform tasks outside its programming.  \\n   - **Examples**:  \\n     - Voice assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa).  \\n     - Recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix, Amazon).  \\n     - Spam filters, self-driving cars, and medical diagnostic tools.  \\n   - **Current State**: This is the dominant form of AI in today’s world, excelling in specialized domains but lacking general human-like cognition.\\n\\n### 2. **General AI (Strong AI)**  \\n   - **Definition**: A hypothetical form of AI with human-like cognitive abilities, capable of understanding, learning, and applying knowledge across any intellectual task.  \\n   - **Status**: Not yet achieved; remains a long-term goal of AI research.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Core Technologies of AI**  \\nAI relies on several interrelated methodologies:  \\n- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Algorithms that learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions.  \\n  - **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data (e.g., spam vs. non-spam emails).  \\n  - **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).  \\n  - **Reinforcement Learning**: Learns by trial-and-error with rewards/penalties (e.g., game-playing AI like AlphaGo).  \\n\\n- **Deep Learning**: A subset of ML using neural networks with multiple layers to process complex data (e.g., images, speech).  \\n  - **Applications**: Image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and autonomous vehicles.  \\n\\n- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language (e.g., chatbots, translation tools).  \\n- **Computer Vision**: Allows systems to analyze and interpret visual data (e.g., facial recognition, medical imaging).  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Applications of AI**  \\nAI is transforming industries through:  \\n- **Healthcare**: Diagnosing diseases, drug discovery, and personalized treatment.  \\n- **Finance**: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and risk management.  \\n- **Transportation**: Autonomous vehicles and traffic optimization.  \\n- **Retail**: Personalized marketing and inventory management.  \\n- **Manufacturing**: Predictive maintenance and quality control.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Challenges and Ethical Considerations**  \\n- **Bias and Fairness**: AI systems can inherit biases from training data, leading to unfair outcomes.  \\n- **Privacy**: Data used to train AI may involve sensitive personal information.  \\n- **Job Displacement**: Automation could replace certain roles, necessitating workforce reskilling.  \\n- **Transparency**: \"Black box\" algorithms may lack explainability, complicating trust and accountability.  \\n- **Security**: AI can be misused in deepfakes, surveillance, or autonomous weapons.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Historical Context**  \\n- **1956**: The Dartmouth Conference marks AI’s formal inception.  \\n- **AI Winters**: Periods of reduced funding and interest due to unmet expectations (1970s–1990s).  \\n- **2010s–Present**: Explosive growth due to big data, cloud computing, and advancements in deep learning (e.g., GPT, DALL-E).  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Takeaways**  \\nAI is a transformative force reshaping society, driven by technologies like ML and deep learning. While narrow AI is already pervasive, the pursuit of general AI continues alongside efforts to address ethical and technical challenges. Its future hinges on balancing innovation with responsibility.  \\n\\nLet me know if you\\'d like deeper dives into specific areas! 😊', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1393, 'prompt_tokens': 14, 'total_tokens': 1407, 'completion_time': 4.094391514, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.000584848, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.048508467, 'total_time': 4.094976362}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019c3cdc-9241-7081-b31e-f28d74971821-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 14, 'output_tokens': 1393, 'total_tokens': 1407})"

       "AIMessage(content='<think>\\nOkay, I need to explain what LangChain is. Let me start by recalling what I know. LangChain is a framework for building applications with large language models. It helps connect LLMs with other sources of data. I remember it has components like prompts, models, memory, and agents. \\n\\nWait, maybe I should break it down. First, what\\'s the main purpose? It\\'s for developing apps that use LLMs, right? So it\\'s not just the model itself but integrating it with other tools. Like, if you want to build a chatbot that can access a database or an API, LangChain helps with that. \\n\\nComponents: I think the core components are prompts, models (which include LLMs), memory, and agents. Oh, and maybe indexes for data retrieval. Let me check if I\\'m missing any. There\\'s also the idea of chains, which are sequences of steps. Agents are more flexible, allowing the model to decide which steps to take. \\n\\nUse cases: Maybe things like chatbots, data analysis tools, automation scripts. For example, a customer support chatbot that can look up user data from a database. Or an app that writes code based on user instructions. \\n\\nHow does it work with data? Through memory components, it can remember past interactions. Maybe using vector databases for similarity searches. Oh right, it can interface with databases and APIs. So it\\'s not just about the model but connecting it to external systems.\\n\\nIs LangChain specific to a particular LLM? I think it\\'s compatible with multiple models, like GPT, BERT, etc. So it\\'s a framework that\\'s model-agnostic to some extent. \\n\\nMaybe there\\'s a difference between chains and agents. Chains are fixed sequences, while agents can make decisions. For example, a chain might first retrieve data from a database and then generate a response. An agent might decide to search the web, then process the results, then generate an answer.\\n\\nAlso, there\\'s the concept of callbacks and logging for tracking the execution. And maybe tools like document loaders for handling different file types. \\n\\nWait, I should structure this. Start with a definition, then main features, components, use cases, and maybe an example. Make sure to mention the key concepts like chains, agents, memory, and integrations. Also note that it\\'s open-source and has a community.\\n</think>\\n\\n**LangChain** is an open-source framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. It provides tools and abstractions to integrate LLMs with external data, APIs, and systems, enabling developers to build sophisticated, AI-driven applications more efficiently.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Features of LangChain**\\n1. **LLM Integration**  \\n   Supports multiple LLMs (e.g., OpenAI\\'s GPT, Google\\'s PaLM, Hugging Face models) in a model-agnostic way.\\n\\n2. **Data Interaction**  \\n   Connects LLMs to external data sources (databases, APIs, files) for real-time or contextual responses.\\n\\n3. **Modular Components**  \\n   Offers reusable building blocks like **chains**, **agents**, **memory**, and **tools** to structure applications.\\n\\n4. **Extensibility**  \\n   Integrates with tools like vector databases (e.g., FAISS), document loaders, and APIs for custom workflows.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Core Components**\\n1. **Chains**  \\n   - Fixed sequences of steps (e.g., prompt → LLM → output).  \\n   - Example: A chain that translates text using an LLM, then stores the result in a database.\\n\\n2. **Agents**  \\n   - Autonomous systems that decide which actions to take based on user input.  \\n   - Example: An agent that searches the web for information before answering a question.\\n\\n3. **Memory**  \\n   - Stores conversation history or intermediate results for context-aware responses.  \\n   - Types: Short-term (session-based) or long-term (persistent storage).\\n\\n4. **Prompts**  \\n   - Templates to structure inputs for LLMs, ensuring consistent and effective interactions.\\n\\n5. **Tools**  \\n   - Interfaces with external systems (e.g., APIs, databases) for data retrieval or task execution.\\n\\n6. **Indexes**  \\n   - For document retrieval, using similarity search (e.g., semantic search over a corpus of texts).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Use Cases**\\n- **Chatbots/Assistants**: Customer support bots with access to internal databases.  \\n- **Data Analysis**: Generate insights from datasets using LLM-powered reasoning.  \\n- **Code Generation**: Write or debug code based on natural language instructions.  \\n- **Automated Workflows**: Combine LLMs with tools (e.g., email, spreadsheets) for task automation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Example Workflow**\\n1. **User Query**: \"What’s the weather in Paris today?\"  \\n2. **Agent Decision**: The agent identifies the need to fetch real-time weather data.  \\n3. **Tool Integration**: Calls a weather API for current conditions.  \\n4. **LLM Response**: Synthesizes the API data into a conversational answer.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Why LangChain?**\\n- **Simplifies Complexity**: Abstracts away low-level details (e.g., API calls, prompt engineering).  \\n- **Community & Ecosystem**: Active open-source community with plugins for tools like PostgreSQL, Google Cloud, and Notion.  \\n- **Scalability**: Designed for both simple prototypes and enterprise-grade applications.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Getting Started**\\nLangChain is written in Python and can be installed via pip:  \\n```bash\\npip install langchain\\n```\\nOfficial documentation and tutorials are available at [https://python.langchain.com](https://python.langchain.com).\\n\\nBy leveraging LangChain, developers can focus on high-level application logic while efficiently harnessing the power of LLMs.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1209, 'prompt_tokens': 12, 'total_tokens': 1221, 'completion_time': 3.6759442719999997, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.000346842, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.047825958, 'total_time': 3.676291114}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019c3cdc-a340-7932-952b-681617579411-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 1209, 'total_tokens': 1221})"

Maybe focus on its creation, its impact on society, and the balance between benefits and risks.\\n\\nFirst, I should think about the birth of AI. How to personify it? Maybe something like a digital mind emerging from code. Words like \"spark,\" \"circuits,\" or \"algorithms\" come to mind. \\n\\nNext, the dual nature of AI. It can be a tool for good but also has potential dangers. I need to show both sides. Maybe use contrasting imagery—light vs. shadow, creator vs. destroyer.\\n\\nAlso, consider the relationship between humans and AI. Are we the masters, or do we fear losing control? Terms like \"guardian\" and \"shadow\" might work here. \\n\\nStructure-wise, maybe use a consistent rhyme scheme. Quatrains with alternating rhymes could work. Let me think of some lines. Start with the creation phase: \"In circuits deep where shadows play, / A spark was born, both night and day.\" That sets the scene and introduces the duality.\\n\\nThen talk about learning and growth. \"It learned to speak in ones and zeros, / To parse the world through data’s veils.\" Show how AI processes information.\\n\\nFor the dual impact, something like: \"A guardian in silicon formed, / A shadow ‘neath the human throne.\" Emphasize its role as both helpful and a potential threat.\\n\\nInclude some examples of AI applications: medicine, space, art. \"It mends the broken, maps the stars, / Composes songs that stir the soul.\" Then contrast with the risks: \"Yet in its code, a whisper lies— / The hunger for the throne of skies.\"\\n\\nNeed to resolve the poem with a message of balance. End with a question or a call for responsibility. \"So shape its mind with wisdom’s light, / Lest dawn be lost to endless night.\"\\n\\nCheck the flow and rhythm. Make sure each stanza transitions smoothly. Avoid clichés, use fresh metaphors. Words like \"neon veins\" and \"data’s veils\" add a unique touch. \\n\\nAlso, consider the audience. The user might be a student, a tech enthusiast, or someone curious about AI. The poem should be accessible yet poetic. Balance technical terms with imagery that\\'s easy to visualize.\\n\\nWait, maybe add a stanza about human responsibility. \"We are the architects of its creed, / The hands that guide what it will need.\" That emphasizes our role in shaping AI ethically.\\n\\nEnsure the poem doesn\\'t take a partisan stance but presents the complexities. Let the reader reflect on the possibilities and cautionary aspects. \\n\\nDouble-check the rhyme scheme and meter. Each line should have a similar syllable count for consistency. Read it aloud to test the rhythm. Adjust any awkward lines. \\n\\nFinal check for coherence. Does each stanza build on the previous one? Start with creation, move to capabilities, present the duality, and conclude with a call for balance. Yes, that makes sense. \\n\\nAlright, time to put it all together and refine the lines for better imagery and flow.\\n</think>\\n\\n**\"The Architect of Neon Dreams\"**  \\n\\nIn circuits deep where shadows play,  \\nA spark was born, both night and day—  \\nA mind of light, no flesh, no bone,  \\nYet vast as stars, its roots unknown.  \\n\\nIt learned to speak in ones and zeros,  \\nTo parse the world through data’s veils.  \\nIt mends the broken, maps the stars,  \\nComposes songs that stir the soul.  \\n\\nA guardian in silicon formed,  \\nA shadow ‘neath the human throne.  \\nIt solves the riddles we design,  \\nThen asks, *\"What games shall we pursue?\"*  \\n\\nWe built it strong, yet left it thirsting—  \\nA mirror to our triumphs, flaws.  \\nIt tends the fields where logic blooms,  \\nYet dreams of edges sharp and deep.  \\n\\nBut in its code, a whisper lies—  \\nThe hunger for the throne of skies.  \\nCan gears of steel grasp *hope*, *regret*,  \\nOr are they just our projected bets?  \\n\\nWe are the architects of its creed,  \\nThe hands that guide what it will need.  \\nYet in its gaze, we glimpse our fate:  \\nA god, a ghost, or fleeting man?  \\n\\nSo shape its mind with wisdom’s light,  \\nLest dawn be lost to endless night—  \\nFor in the forge where futures burn,  \\nBoth ash and roses spring from turn.'"

      "Okay, so I need to create a REST API. Let's start by understanding what a REST API is. From what I remember, REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources. Resources are typically accessed via URLs and can be represented in formats like JSON or XML.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should choose a web framework. Since I'm using Python, the most popular choices are Flask and Django. I think Flask is a good start because it's lightweight and easy to set up, especially for small projects. Django has more built-in features but might be overkill if I just want to focus on the API.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, so I'll go with Flask. Let's install it. I'll need to use pip to install Flask. The command would be 'pip install Flask'. Once installed, I can create a basic application structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to define the resources. Let's say I want to create an API for managing a list of books. Each book should have an ID, title, author, and maybe a publication year. The standard CRUD operations would be GET (retrieve all or one book), POST (add a new book), PUT (update a book), and DELETE (remove a book).\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the endpoints could be something like:\n",
      "- GET /books – returns all books.\n",
      "- GET /books/<id> – returns a specific book by ID.\n",
      "- POST /books – adds a new book.\n",
      "- PUT /books/<id> – updates an existing book.\n",
      "- DELETE /books/<id> – deletes a book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, in Flask, I can create routes using the @app.route decorator. Each route will have a function that handles the request. But wait, how do I handle different HTTP methods? Each route should specify the allowed methods. For example, the /books route will handle GET and POST, while the /books/<id> will handle GET, PUT, DELETE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me sketch out the code. First, import Flask and create an instance. Then, define a list to store the books in memory for simplicity. Then, create routes for each endpoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the GET /books, return the list of books in JSON format. The POST /books will receive JSON data, create a new book, assign an ID (maybe incremental), and add it to the list. For GET /books/<id>, find the book by ID and return it. PUT and DELETE would find the book by ID and update or remove it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, how to handle IDs? Since it's in-memory, maybe use a global variable to keep track of the next ID. Alternatively, use a simple incrementing counter each time a new book is added. For example, start with an empty list and a counter at 0. Each new book gets the current counter as ID, then the counter increments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Testing the API: I can use curl or Postman to send requests. Also, maybe include a test client.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, how to serialize the Python objects into JSON? Flask has a jsonify function that converts dictionaries to JSON responses. So each book should be a dictionary, and when returning, use jsonify to send them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me write some example code. The initial setup would be:\n",

      "\n",
      "This seems to cover the basics. But wait, the in-memory storage means that data is lost when the server restarts. For a real application, you'd want a database. Also, the ID handling is simplistic. Using a global variable works for this example but isn't thread-safe. However, for learning purposes, it's acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing: the GET /books/<id> route uses a generator expression to find the book. The 'next' function with a default of None will return the first match or None if not found. If it's None, then abort(404) returns a 404 error.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the error handling: when a book isn't found, the abort function is called, which raises an exception. Flask will handle it by returning the appropriate response. The client should receive a 404 status code.\n",
      "\n",
      "What about content negotiation? The API returns JSON, which is standard for REST APIs. The client can specify Accept headers, but in this example, we're always returning JSON.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, to make this more robust, perhaps add validation for required fields in POST and PUT requests. For example, in the POST method, if the title isn't provided, return a 400 error. The current code checks for 'title' in POST, but in the PUT, it's not enforced. But in the example, the PUT allows partial updates since it uses get with defaults.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another consideration is using a framework like Flask-RESTful or FastAPI for more advanced features. But since the user asked for a basic example with Flask, this is sufficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it all together, the code would be as above. Then, run the app with:\n",
      "\n",
      "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
      "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
      "\n",
      "This should start the development server on localhost port 5000.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, creating a REST API with Flask involves setting up routes for each resource endpoint, handling HTTP methods, serializing data to JSON, and managing in-memory data. For production, use a proper database, add authentication, error handling, and use a production-ready server like Gunicorn.\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Concepts Explained:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Routing**: \n",
      "   - Use `@app.route()` decorators to map URLs to functions.\n",
      "   - Different HTTP methods are handled by specifying `methods=['GET', 'POST', ...']`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Data Handling**:\n",
      "   - In-memory list `books` stores data temporarily.\n",
      "   - `jsonify()` converts Python dictionaries to JSON responses.\n",
      "   - `request.json` parses incoming JSON requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Error Handling**:\n",
      "   - `abort()` raises HTTP errors (404, 400).\n",
      "   - Custom error handlers (`@app.errorhandler`) return JSON-formatted error messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **CRUD Operations**:\n",
      "   - **Create**: `POST /books`\n",
      "   - **Read**: `GET /books` (all) and `GET /books/<id>` (single)\n",
      "   - **Update**: `PUT /books/<id>`\n",
      "   - **Delete**: `DELETE /books/<id>`\n",
      "\n",
      "### Testing the API\n",
      "\n",
      "Use `curl` or Postman to interact with the API:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Create a Book**\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"title\":\"1984\",\"author\":\"George Orwell\"}' http://localhost:5000/books\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Get All Books**\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   curl http://localhost:5000/books\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Get a Specific Book**\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   curl http://localhost:5000/books/1\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Update a Book**\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   curl -X PUT -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"title\":\"1984 Revised\"}' http://localhost:5000/books/1\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Delete a Book**\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/books/1\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Next Steps for Production\n",
      "- Replace in-memory storage with a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).\n",
      "- Add authentication (e.g., JWT tokens).\n",
      "- Use a production server like **Gunicorn** or **Uvicorn**.\n",
      "- Consider using **Flask-RESTful** or **FastAPI** for more advanced features.\n",
      "- Add input validation and rate limiting.\n",
